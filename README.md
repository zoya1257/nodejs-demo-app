#  CI/CD Automation for Node.js App using GitHub Actions

##  Overview
This project demonstrates a *fully automated CI/CD pipeline* that builds and deploys a Node.js web application using *GitHub Actions* and *DockerHub*.  
Every time new code is pushed to the main branch, the pipeline automatically builds a Docker image and publishes it to DockerHub.

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- *GitHub Actions* – CI/CD automation  
- *Docker & DockerHub* – Containerization and image hosting  
- *Node.js* – Web application framework  
- *YAML* – Workflow configuration  

---

##  CI/CD Workflow Summary
1. Code is pushed to the main branch.  
2. GitHub Actions triggers the pipeline.  
3. The app dependencies are installed and Docker image is built.  
4. The image is pushed automatically to DockerHub.
